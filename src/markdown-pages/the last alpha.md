One of the hardest moments of retail investing to face is the one where your realize the following in the same moment:

- a full grasp of the market, given the amount of time you're putting into it, is impossible
- no matter how clever you are, your short-term trades, if performed consistently, will fail for longer than you can remain emotionally solvent
- it will never matter how much analysis you do, nor how many books, articles, and insights you read: you will always be less informed and less equipped than even the most meager of hedge funds

What a trio. You're outgunned. You're outmanned. The ROI of your time investment in learning is minimal in the short term.

There are only two weapons that survive the inevitable fates. By my own math, they're Time and Perspective.

You don't need a Perspective to be in the market for a longer period of time. Most salaried employees make long time horizon bets every paycheck by putting away money in their 401(k).

But what if that time horizon were longer than your retirement? What if the time horizon were generational? Dynastic, by their very definition.

What if Morgan O'Briant, my great-grandfather 8 times over, settling into new his life in colonial America, had thought forward to where I am today. He couldn't see the future; he couldn't fathom the laptop that I type these words on now, or the website on which they'll be hosted. But is it too much of a jump to believe that money would still play a factor in day to day life, as it had for the previous ten thousand years? Is it a huge logical jump that having a great deal of that wealth would be better than having a meager amount?

What about myself now? I do not know my great-great-grandchildren, but what if I invested the extra dollars I'm lucky enough to earn for their benefit? How would that change my investing habits?

Note: I was originally going to reach the topic of investing by ranting about how misgiven day traders are about their ability to outperform the market over time, but I got too mad and pulled back haha.

I'm rarely one to complain about the scariness of digital ad technology. I'm not scared of how much data Google, Apple, or Facebook have collected about me. I've found it more helpful than not, on average, while searching for new products in categories that I've never thought about before. Sure, mattress ads are annoying. Sure there are 500 companies in the BTC mattress space all clamoring to convince me their foam is better than the next guy. But, when I actually go try them out, at least I have some foundational knowledge on the topic.

If anything, it's a little disappointing how much these algorithms don't understand me. How many times do I have to face an ad about day trading in the stock market because I googled to find out when a company was IPO'ing?

Here's a new way to think about your mortal existence:
Don't think about how many more days you get to spend with your parents. Instead, calculate how many more times Tai Lopez will try to convince you that the Lambo in his garage is actually his, and that he got it by reading the latest pop sci books. Why does a man as wealthy as Tai need to make his garage serve as a dual purpose library? Surely there is a second room for all those books on his vast estate?

There are a thousand molotovs I could lob over the fence at these gurus of Robinhood and dropshipping, but I digress.
