This blog has returned, but in a new form, equally minimal in its own way. I love to write, because I love to think; and I often write to think. But by repeatedly discover that my writing desires a conclusion that I do not. The weight of these conclusions have pulled my writing habits back down to the Earth time and time again.

Even now, writing these first few paragraphs, I can feel my brain straining out into the fog of these ideas searching for the solid idea under the mist. I'm actively turning away from it.

Here's my problem: Goals are too easy to create, and never worth the pain that they bring.

Let's walk it through:
I listen to a podcast, and, inspired by the conversation go and tear through the writings of the guest. As I tear through their bibliography - blography? - I sooner or later come face to face with the fact that the only difference between my writing, and that of the author, is that the author kept writing in public.

And without a sound, a new desire has entered the chat.

Desires are nothing until you move from observer to possessor. I buy a URL and write for a week or two before the desire begins to step out from behind the curtain. Where the first articles were exploratory, I have started to think of themes for new articles - or a series of them. They're under the guise of exploring, but the true intent is to explore _in public_. Public writing needs a public audience; and public audiences want takeaways, conclusions. They want form - Forms like the blogs I devoured, or the hundreds of books stacked in the living room. This writing isn't about thinking, it is about persuasively sharing the conclusions of thought.

Audience is now a part of the desire. An audience cannot be held or obtained without good distribution, and that means a schedule and consistent format. How often should I push my thinking to produce something of value to others, instead of providing clarity to myself? Once a week? Twice? Once a month?

What was now a formless desire now has a glimmering outline. Like water finding its way through the tiniest cracks, it has begun to corrupt this simple effort. It freezes and expands as I turn the possibilities over in my mind.

What do I start writing about? A foothold of credibility has to be established somewhere. All these great blogs started with incredible focus on one topic, and widened it out over time. Their audience followed them on that journey because that initial credibility built trust. The momentum of the credibility aided their forays beyond their perceived expertise.

The goal takes shape.

I'll write once a week. I've been playing a lot of Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord, I'll write about the economic model which I'm using to rapidly scale my trading empire. I'm applying real world economic principles to a simulated economy in a medieval world, that'll be interesting to fellow history-econ-video game nerds like me. There are dozens of us! I'm pretty sure I follow several people online that I could send it to...

A transition has happened.

I'm no longer playing with my own thought, I'm building something: A several part series of articles, published weekly, and put out on Twitter.

Those three criteria now exist in a realm which we can only reach into mentally. The perfect ideal of this project that I hold in my mind sits downwind from the Platonic ideals. In it, I can see readers following along as I slowly build out a financial model for this game, and enjoy the bad jokes I make along the way. I can see the first subscriptions from strangers to my inevitable Substack roll in. I can feel a shimmer of the prideful warmth of a completed goal. It's perfect.

And now all that is left to do is to tear away at that infinitely perfect ideal of a project and painfully birth it to the finite world I reside in.
