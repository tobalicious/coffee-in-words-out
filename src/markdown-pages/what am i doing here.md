This blog has returned, but in a new form, equally minimal in its own way. I love to write because I love to think; I often write to think. But I have repeatedly discovered that my writing desires finite conclusions that I do not. The weight of these conclusions has pulled my writing habits back down to Earth time and time again.

Even now, writing these first few paragraphs, I can feel my brain straining out into the fog searching for the a solid idea in the mist to grab a hold of. I'm actively turning away from it.

Here's my problem: Goals are too easy to create, and never worth the pain that they bring.

Let's walk it through:
I listen to a podcast, and, inspired by the conversation, go and tear through the writings of the guest. As I read through their bibliography - biblography? blography? - I sooner or later come face to face with the fact that the only difference between my writing, and that of the author, is that the author kept writing in public.

And without a sound, a new desire has entered the chat.

Desires are nothing until you move from observer to possessor. I buy a URL and write for a week or two before the desire begins to step out from behind the curtain. Where the first articles were exploratory, I have started to think of themes for new articles - or a series of them. They're under the guise of exploring, but the true intent is to explore _in public_. Public writing needs a public audience; and public audiences want takeaways, conclusions. They want form - Forms like the blogs I devoured, or the hundreds of books stacked in the living room. This writing isn't about thinking, it is about persuasively sharing the conclusions of thought.

An audience is now a part of the desire. An audience cannot be held or obtained without good distribution, and that means a schedule and consistent format. How often should I push my thinking to produce something of value to others, instead of providing clarity to myself? Once a week? Twice? Once a month?

What was now a formless desire now has a glimmering outline. Like water finding its way through the tiniest cracks, it has begun to corrupt this simple effort. It freezes and expands as I turn the possibilities over in my mind.

What do I start writing about? A foothold of credibility has to be established somewhere. All these great blogs started with incredible focus on one topic and widened it out over time. Their audience followed them on that journey because that initial credibility built trust. The momentum of the credibility aided their forays beyond their perceived expertise.

The goal takes shape.

I'll write once a week. I've been playing a lot of Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord, I'll write about the economic model which I'm using to rapidly scale my trading empire. I'm applying real-world economic principles to a simulated economy in a medieval world, that'll be interesting to fellow history-econ-video game nerds like me. There are dozens of us! I'm pretty sure I follow several people online that I could send it to...

A transition has happened.

I'm no longer playing with my own thought, I'm building something: A several part series of articles, published weekly, and put out on Twitter.

Those three criteria now exist in a realm which we can only reach into mentally. The perfect ideal of this project that I hold in my mind sits downwind from the Platonic Ideals. In it, I can see readers following along as I slowly build out a financial model for this game, and enjoy the bad jokes I make along the way. I can see the first subscriptions from strangers to my inevitable Substack roll in. I can feel a shimmer of the prideful warmth of a completed goal. It's perfect.

And now all that is left to do is to tear away at that infinitely perfect ideal of a project and painfully birth it to the finite world I reside in.

Having moved from the observer of the forming desire (which calls itself a goal), to its possessor, this painful birth is yours to bear.

In bringing this goal to its Earthly realizations, you must approximate and abstraction. Trade-offs must be made. Imperfections will be introduced. We start with a square and must shape it into a perfect circle, which is beyond the realm of possibility for our domain.

Grammar in the articles written will be imperfect, as it surely is here. Tweet engagements won't live up to my aspirations. Writing time horizons must be stretched by weeks or months. Turns out, I'm not capable of writing a new article every week because I have a full-time job and sometimes I'm mentally exhausted. Even if the writing is some of my best, the ideal project output I'm holding in my mind still has to come and meet reality's imperfections. As more flaws and defects find their way into the project, the warmth of the idea fades from my mind. The cold breeze of pain follows.

Work will slow as interest fades, and I'll stop writing.

Lured by desire, I created a goal to achieve pleasure by creating a series of objects that I built in my mind. The more I constructed these objects, the more friction I found. Friction brought with it pain that combated pleasure until pain won. What if I succeeded? Would I truly feel different?

No.

Even if the goal was achieved, and I held reality at bay as much as possible. What is the reward? New ideas for expanding. A new feature on the blog. 100 more followers or subscribers. How do I monetize? The desire is insatiable, and so is the well of pain. The pleasure itself is fleeting.

How many wise men from every age of Man have to repeat the same advice: internalizing the finite external in your soul is a recipe for sadness and pain.

Desire and pain are not separate ideas. You cannot fulfill a desire and keep only the pleasure of its fulfillment. The pain is the other side of its coin. The pain drives you toward the conclusion of pleasure. And the result of the goal, being held in the mind, that is the driving source of pain. Is there no harder task than freeing the mind of the desire to seek a result?

How does one ignore the entrapment of this cycle?

I think it's a process akin to mindfulness.

When a thought enters your mind in mindfulness meditation, you are to watch as if it were a cloud floating by in the sky. It is a part of your mind, but apart from your soul. Desires are just stronger thoughts. What if you were to stay the observer of desire, and held yourself back from becoming the possessor of even the most alluring ideas?

The desire wasn't to write, it was to write and succeed at writing like the person I had heard on the podcast. It had nothing to do with the act of writing or my passion for it. The goal gave this desire form; it continued to bring it down a path that could only lead to pain. But what if I could write in such a way that was for the act of writing - the act of thinking and exploring - before it was about subscribers, or Twitter engagement, or any sense of fulfillment?

What if my words could be play, instead of the meaningless work to realize a goal that isn't based in passion, but desire?

And here we have arrived at the titular question: What am I doing here?

I'm thinking. I'm thinking in public.

In many ways, I don't want anyone to read this blog. I want people to read the conclusions I come to on my actual website after exploring their many facets here. I don't want them to read the unpruned drafts, I want them to thumb through finished content. But I need a place to explore. And that's this blog.

The design is minimal because this is both my sketch pad and my pencil. It's the bits of the notebook that you keep because the 12 wrong ways you sketched the subject the first time might actually pay off in the final product. It's the song recordings that stay unbounced in Logic Pro X next to the mastered song that makes it on the LP.

This is my thought playground. I'd apologize for the rambling, but it's kind of the point.
